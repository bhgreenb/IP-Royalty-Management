Claim Business Plan
 
1. Executive Summary
The $40 billion music recording and publishing ecosystem begins with a single seed: a copyrighted work. But once this creative seed sprouts, it’s thrust into a fragmented, archaic ecosystem. The result is a high-friction, error-prone royalty system that penalizes songwriters and their collaborators with lost earnings, duplicated admin work, and buried metadata.
Claim is a user-friendly, cloud-based platform that offers a centralized System of Record (SoR) for intellectual property (IP) and royalty management. Built for artists, their lawyers, business managers, and collaborators, Claim automates metadata capture, streamlines contract negotiation, simplifies rights tracking, and connects with downstream royalty processors.
The result: faster contracting, clearer royalty splits, safer data, and less sludge.
 
2. The Problem
Current Pain Points:
●	IP and royalty data scattered across inboxes, PDFs, and spreadsheets
●	Complex ownership webs due to frequent label/publisher switches
●	Poor organization of contracts leads to delayed or missed payments
●	No unified system for tracking royalties across contracts and catalogs
Industry Impact:
●	Songs are cleared too slowly, adding legal and admin cost
●	Contributors often get paid late (or not at all)
●	Royalty errors and misallocations are common
 
3. The Solution
Claim streamlines music IP and royalty administration with:
●	Contract Creator & Negotiator: Online third-party contributor agreements (producers, features, co-writers, mixers, etc.)
●	Split & Rights Tracker: Dashboard for storing and updating splits, royalties, credits, obligations
●	Royalty Management Tools: Upload and desk-audit statements, track payments, valuations, and catalog sales
●	Clearance Dashboard: One-click visibility into contract status and reminders
●	Mobile-first Design: Artists and collaborators receive texts/emails linking them directly to needed actions
 
4. Target Market
Ideal Customers:
●	Entertainment lawyers and music law firms
●	Business managers tracking royalties, advances, and IP
●	Managers needing visibility into client catalogs
●	Musicians, producers, and songwriters of all genres and sizes
Long-term Users: Labels, publishers, PROs, and rights aggregators
 
5. Unique Selling Points
●	Designed by industry insiders who understand material risks and workflows
●	Merges contracting, rights management, and royalty visibility in one tool
●	Speaks both "legal" and "creative"—focused on clarity, convenience, and cashflow

6. Business Model
